Week 1 Code Challenge

Prerequisite
1. Create a repository on your GitHub account.
2. Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.
3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.
4. Submit the repository link for grading.

Solutions

In the repository listed above, there are three folders
1. challenge-1
2. challenge-2
3. challenge-3

            Challenge -1 Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

    Task : Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 

    A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

Solution : In the challenge-1 folder, there is an index.js file linked with an index.html file.
The index.js file has an if else statement that calculates the input of marks and gives out the expected grade



        
            Challenge -2 Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

    Task : Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

    Solution : else if statement to calculate the total points accumulated in every speed range and issue relevant demerit points. If points exceed 12, it returns "Licence Suspended"


                Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

        Task : Given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, write a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.

        NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.

        Solution : create a function that calculates gross salary, and deducts paye, nhif, nssf.
        calculates total allowances and deductions
        create a function that will generate the net-pay of salary entered
